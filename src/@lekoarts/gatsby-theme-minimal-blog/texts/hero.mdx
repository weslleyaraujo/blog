  Before that, I’ve spent 5 years at 
  <a href="http://booking.com">Booking.com</a> (the biggest travel website in the
  world 🌎) as a <strong>Senior Front End Developer</strong>, where I joined at age
  of 22 👶. During these years there, I’ve seen several verticals of the company,
  from working directly with customers building complex internal facing platforms
  to their main web and mobile funnel. As well as building a completely separate
  web and mobile app to help travelers discover the world.
