  Hi.

<Text sx={{ fontSize: [2, 4, 5],  color: `heading` }}>
  My name is Weslley and I am a self-taught Software Engineer who loves **UX engineering**. Based on the Netherlands and trying not to freak out during this world pandemic.

  Currently, I am working at [REKKI](http://rekki.com), a mobile app that connects restaurants with food suppliers. My team is responsible for sharping the app's performance on React Native as well as improving the developer experience within the company.

  Before that, I’ve spent 5 years at [Booking.com](booking.com) (the biggest travel website in the world 🌎) as a **Senior Front End Developer**, where I joined at age of 22 👶. During these years there, I’ve seen several verticals of the company, from working directly with customers building complex internal facing platforms to their main web and mobile funnel. As well as building a completely separate web and mobile app to help travelers discover the world.

  Prior, I’ve worked with one of the [largest sports goods e-commerce in south America](http://netshoes.com.br) to the [third biggest television and media company in Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Record) where I started my career right after high school and this reminds me that I’ve just reached a mark of **10 years working with engineering and UX** 🎉
